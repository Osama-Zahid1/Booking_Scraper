## Script Workflow

1. **Initialize WebDriver:** Sets up a Chrome WebDriver instance and navigates to the target Booking.com hotel reviews page.
2. **Extract Hotel Information:**
   - Scrapes the hotel name, number of reviews, and average rating.
3. **Extract Individual Reviews:**
   - Iterates through all reviews on the page and retrieves details such as guest ID, country, review date, pros/cons, and ratings.
   - Handles missing data gracefully using conditional checks.
4. **Save Data:** Compiles the extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame and saves it to a CSV file.
5. **Close WebDriver:** Ensures the browser instance is properly closed after scraping.

## Limitations

- **Dynamic Website Structure:** If Booking.com changes its HTML structure or class names, the script may require adjustments to selectors.
- **Pagination:** This script only scrapes reviews on the initial page. Adding support for pagination can enable scraping reviews across multiple pages.
- **Rate Limiting:** Excessive scraping may trigger rate limiting or captchas. Consider adding delays or randomization to avoid detection.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement support for pagination to scrape all reviews for a hotel.
- Add functionality to scrape additional data, such as reviewer's profile picture or stay details.
- Use a headless browser to run the script in the background for increased efficiency.
